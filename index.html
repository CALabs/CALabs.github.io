		<h1>Christian Arroyo</h1>
		<p>
			I am an investment Banking Sr. Analyst with a strong drive for technology for good (impact investing) and new ventures. I am currently under a new venture called SkyLabs and Origin Ventures to create a VC platform that can deliver and deploy good returns for our believers (share/stakeholders) and to help promising companies which main drive is to improve quality of life for people with their product, service or technology, that has the potential to be scalable and adaptable to different regions worldwide.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>I believe this can help maximize the use of capital by delivering returns but also improving people's lives</strong>
